API
---

### genDiffCtx(report[, opts])

  * `report`: the one generated by `generic-diff` or a compatible module.
  * `opts`: config object
    * `mergePairs`: (bool) (default: `false`)
      Whether pairs of deletion and addition shall be merged.
    * `unified`: (number | object | bool) (default: `false`)
      With number(s) given, return a unified diff, i.e. array of changes,
      each change being an array of lines changed.
      The number sets how much context = how many unchanged items to include
      on both sides of the change(s).
      Give an object with number properties `before` and `after` to select
      them separately. You can also use the `0` property instead of `before`,
      and `1`, instead of `after`, so an array of two numbers will work.
    * `finalLf`: (bool) (default: false; default in `unified` mode: true)
      Whether to report the trailing newline as GNU diff does:
      If the last line has a newline at its end, omit it,
      otherwise add a message that there was no newline at end of input.


### genDiffCtx(a, b[, opts])

Like above, but generate the report by `generic-diff`ing `a` and `b`.
